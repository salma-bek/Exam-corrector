In this project, we aim to create a system that allows you to correct a Qcm exam on paper. To carry 
out this project, we relied on neural networks that allowed us to do optical pattern recognition. We 
used the Matlab language because the Matlab language offers a specified toolbox for neural networks and deep learning.
We learned the possible answers to a QCM composed of 3 answers per question. Then, we trained our 
network and finally we did the test on new examples.
